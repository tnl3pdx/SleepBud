## Product Overview
Sleep Bud transcends the functionality of a simple alarm clock, serving as a comprehensive sleep companion designed to enhance your sleep quality. It features mood-inducing lights and gentle non-intrusive waking sounds. Essentially, this innovative device is a hybrid between a traditional alarm clock and a multi-color lamp.
Why?? Because according to the CDC 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems and the current market solutions are too expensive.
